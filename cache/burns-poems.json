        "text": "Argument.\n\n\n\nHoly Willie was a rather oldish bachelor elder, in the parish of\nMauchline, and much and justly famed for that polemical chattering, which ends\nin tippling orthodoxy, and for that spiritualized bawdry which refines to\nliquorish devotion. In a sessional process with a gentleman in Mauchline-a\nMr.Gavin Hamilton-Holy Willie and his priest, Father Auld, after full hearing\nin the presbytery of Ayr, came off but second best; owing partly to the\noratorical powers of Mr. Robert Aiken, Mr. Hamilton's counsel; but chiefly to\nMr. Hamilton's being one of the most irreproachable and truly respectable\ncharacters in the county. On losing the process, the muse overheard him\n[Holy Willie] at his devotions, as follows:-\n O Thou, who in the heavens does dwell,\nWho, as it pleases best Thysel',\nSends ane to heaven an' ten to hell,\nA' for Thy glory,\nAnd no for ony gude or ill\nThey've done afore Thee!\n I bless and praise Thy matchless might,\nWhen thousands Thou hast left in night,\nThat I am here afore Thy sight,\nFor gifts an' grace\nA burning and a shining light\nTo a' this place.\n What was I, or my generation,\nThat I should get sic exaltation,\nI wha deserve most just damnation\nFor broken laws,\nFive thousand years ere my creation,\nThro' Adam's cause?\n When frae my mither's womb I fell,\nThou might hae plunged me in hell,\nTo gnash my gums, to weep and wail,\nIn burnin lakes,\nWhere damned devils roar and yell,\nChain'd to their stakes.\n Yet I am here a chosen sample,\nTo show thy grace is great and ample;\nI'm here a pillar o' Thy temple,\nStrong as a rock,\nA guide, a buckler, and example,\nTo a' Thy flock.\n O Lord, Thou kens what zeal I bear,\nWhen drinkers drink, an' swearers swear,\nAn' singin there, an' dancin here,\nWi' great and sma';\nFor I am keepit by Thy fear\nFree frae them a'.\n But yet, O Lord! confess I must,\nAt times I'm fash'd wi' fleshly lust:\nAn' sometimes, too, in wardly trust,\nVile self gets in:\nBut Thou remembers we are dust,\nDefil'd wi' sin.\n O Lord! yestreen, Thou kens, wi' Meg-\nThy pardon I sincerely beg,\nO! may't ne'er be a livin plague\nTo my dishonour,\nAn' I'll ne'er lift a lawless leg\nAgain upon her.\n Besides, I farther maun allow,\nWi' Leezie's lass, three times I trow-\nBut Lord, that Friday I was fou,\nWhen I cam near her;\nOr else, Thou kens, Thy servant true\nWad never steer her.\n Maybe Thou lets this fleshly thorn\nBuffet Thy servant e'en and morn,\nLest he owre proud and high shou'd turn,\nThat he's sae gifted:\nIf sae, Thy han' maun e'en be borne,\nUntil Thou lift it.\n Lord, bless Thy chosen in this place,\nFor here Thou hast a chosen race:\nBut God confound their stubborn face,\nAn' blast their name,\nWha bring Thy elders to disgrace\nAn' public shame.\n Lord, mind Gaw'n Hamilton's deserts;\nHe drinks, an' swears, an' plays at cartes,\nYet has sae mony takin arts,\nWi' great and sma',\nFrae God's ain priest the people's hearts\nHe steals awa.\n An' when we chasten'd him therefor,\nThou kens how he bred sic a splore,\nAn' set the warld in a roar\nO' laughing at us;-\nCurse Thou his basket and his store,\nKail an' potatoes.\n Lord, hear my earnest cry and pray'r,\nAgainst that Presbyt'ry o' Ayr;\nThy strong right hand, Lord, make it bare\nUpo' their heads;\nLord visit them, an' dinna spare,\nFor their misdeeds.\n O Lord, my God! that glib-tongu'd Aiken,\nMy vera heart and flesh are quakin,\nTo think how we stood sweatin', shakin,\nAn' p-'d wi' dread,\nWhile he, wi' hingin lip an' snakin,\nHeld up his head.\n Lord, in Thy day o' vengeance try him,\nLord, visit them wha did employ him,\nAnd pass not in Thy mercy by 'em,\nNor hear their pray'r,\nBut for Thy people's sake, destroy 'em,\nAn' dinna spare.\n But, Lord, remember me an' mine\nWi' mercies temp'ral an' divine,\nThat I for grace an' gear may shine,\nExcell'd by nane,\nAnd a' the glory shall be thine,\nAmen, Amen!",
